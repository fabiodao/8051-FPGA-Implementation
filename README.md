# 8051 Microcontroler on FPGA

This github contains the implementation of the 8051 Microcontroler in Verilog HDL. The main objective was to design a 8051 Microcontroller with a reduced ISA, using fixed length instructions, and finally to implement it in hardware using a Field-programmable gate array (FPGA).
